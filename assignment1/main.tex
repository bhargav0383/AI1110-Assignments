  \section*{Question 6(b)}
   A conical tent is to accommodate 77 persons.Each person must  
   have $16m^3$ of air to breathe.Given the radius of the tent as
   $7m$ find the height of the tent and also its curved surface
   area.\\
  \section*{Solution:}
  Given a conical tent which can accommodate 77 persons and each         
   person must have $16m^3$ of air to breathe.\\
  so the volume of conical tent is,
  \begin{align}
    v = 77 \times 16 m^3 \\
    v = 1232 m^3  
  \end{align}

    \label{table:Table1}
  \end{table} \\
  
  we know that volume of conical tent is same as a cone having
  radius $r$,height $h$,
  \begin{align}
     v = \frac{\pi r^2 h}{3} 
  \end{align}
  from the question we are given radius of cone, \\
  $ r = 7 m $\\ 
  height of cone is
  \begin{align}
   h = \frac{3 v}{\pi r^2} 
  \end{align}
  By substituting values we can get, \\
  $ h = 24 m $ \\\\
  
  Now we know radius and height so we can find lateral height $l$
  which is given by,
  \begin{align}
     l &= \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
     \\
     l &= \sqrt{7^2 + 24^2}
     \\
     l &= 25 m
  \end{align}

  \section*{Steps for generating the figure}
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item First construct a isosceles triangle taking length of base as $2r$ and height of triangle as $h$.
     \item Then,construct a ellipse taking center at midpoint of base of triangle.
     \item Taking semi-major axis length $r$ and semi-minor axis of desired length($<r$) for ellipse.
     \item To indicate height of cone construct a dotted line which is median of triangle and indicate other dimensions also.
   \end{enumerate} 
  
  We know that lateral/curved surface area $s$ of a cone is given
  by,
  \begin{align}
     s &= \pi \times r \times l 
     \\
     s &= \frac{22}{7} \times 7 \times 25  
     \\
     s &= 550 m^2 
  \end{align}
   
  Hence the curved surface area is $ 550 m^2 $. \\\\
